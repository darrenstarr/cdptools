# Linux CDP Client Module

## About

This is a project which aims to implement the Cisco Discovery Protocol for use on Linux. It's not unique as there have been many other implementations before it. But it is implemented as a proper "first-class" SNAP citizen and does not depend on performing all packet filtering in user mode.

The current state of the project is that it appears to work quite well on Ethernet interfaces and has been tested against several devices. It is currently running in the lab on Raspberry Pis and on virtual machines.
